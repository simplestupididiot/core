    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "Welcome this is just an example file for developers." to "/welcome.txt"

  Scenario Outline: download a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" downloads file "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the downloaded content should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
